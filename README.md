# Gym Membership System API

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Our project is a Gym Membership System API that enables users and administrators to manage essential gym operations. Users can create accounts, view and filter available fitness classes, book classes, and track their own check-in history. The system supports different membership tiers, allowing users to start, pause, or cancel their memberships. Admins and trainers can create and update class schedules, manage user attendance, view class capacities, and handle payment records.

Itâ€™s designed to be used by both gym-goers and staff, making it easier to keep everything organized â€” from class bookings to user roles â€” all in one system. The backend uses a relational database to store users, memberships, class data, and more.

The **Gym Membership System** is a database-backed application designed to help gyms efficiently manage members, trainers, classes, and workout plans. This project aims to streamline operations by keeping track of:

- Member profiles and membership types
- Trainer assignments and class schedules
- Class registrations and attendance

By implementing this system, gym staff can reduce manual workload, improve organization, and provide a better experience for members.
