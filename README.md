The **Gym Membership System** is a database-backed application designed to help gyms efficiently manage members, trainers, classes, and workout plans. This project aims to streamline operations by keeping track of:

- Member profiles and membership types
- Trainer assignments and class schedules
- Class registrations and attendance
- Personalized workout plans and exercises

By implementing this system, gym staff can reduce manual workload, improve organization, and provide a better experience for members.
